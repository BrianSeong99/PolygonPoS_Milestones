## 1. Introduction to Bor and Heimdall in Polygon PoS

### 1.1 What is Bor?

Bor is the execution layer in the Polygon Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network. It is responsible for:

- Aggregating transactions into blocks.
- Managing the execution of smart contracts.
- Maintaining the state of the Polygon network, such as account balances.

### 1.2 What is Heimdall?

Heimdall acts as the proof of stake layer and uses Tendermint BFT consensus. It decides which validators should be producing blocks in Bor in each span (based on their stake). It also:

- Submits checkpoints to the Ethereum mainnet, securing the Polygon chain.
- Helps in arriving at finality of Bor blocks using Milestones.
- Plays a key role in state sync mechanism from L1 to Bor.

### 1.3 How Do They Work Together?

Heimdall determines the validators that should be part of the next span. Bor fetches these details from Heimdall and the selected validators start producing blocks based on the consensus rules. Heimdall also periodically aggregates Bor blocks and submits checkpoints to L1 (Ethereum) to secure the network.

Heimdall is also responsible for the finality of blocks produced by Bor which is achieved through a mechanism called Milestones. And we will be diving deeper into Milestones in this tutorial.

### 1.4 More on Bor and Heimdall

Check out the official [documentation](https://docs.polygon.technology/pos/architecture/#architectural-overview) for more details on Bor and Heimdall

## 2. The Evolution of Finality: Before and After Milestones

### 2.1 Before Milestones

In the traditional setup:

- Finality was **probabilistic** until a checkpoint was submitted to L1. Users and developers had to wait for many blocks (some applications waited 256 blocks) to be created before they could be reasonably sure that a transaction was final. This meant that there was always a small chance of a reorganization (reorg), where a different chain might become the canonical chain.

- Checkpoints to Ethereum: Heimdall would submit checkpoints to Ethereum after every 256 blocks (minimum), anchoring Polygonâ€™s state to the security of Ethereum. However, finality on the Polygon chain itself was slow and uncertain until this checkpoint was confirmed.

Finality achieved after 256 blocks (approx. 10 minutes)

### 2.2 After Milestones

With the introduction of milestones:

- Finality is **deterministic** even before a checkpoint is submitted to L1. After a certain number of blocks (minimum 12), a milestone is proposed and voted by Heimdall. Once 2/3+ of the network agrees, the milestone is finalized, and all transactions up to that milestone are considered final, with no chance of reorganization.

- Separation of Checkpoints and Milestones: Checkpoints still occur every 256 blocks (minimum) and are submitted to Ethereum. However, milestones provide much faster finality on the Polygon chain itself, using Heimdall layer for finalization, improving the user experience significantly.

![Finality After Milestones](./pics/milestones.png)

Finality achieved after at least 12 blocks confirmation and 16 blocks of buffer, as well as a voting period among the validators (approx. 1-2 minute)

### 3.2 Using the Milestone API

Here's a simple code example to check if a transaction has reached finality using the milestone mechanism.

Import Relevant Libraries:
```typescript
import { createPublicClient, http, Hash } from 'viem'
import { polygon, polygonAmoy } from 'viem/chains'
import { program } from 'commander'
```

Here's the implementation of Checking Transaction Finality BEFORE Milestones Implementation.
```typescript
async function pre_milestones_checkFinality(client: any, txHash: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const tx = await client.getTransaction({ hash: `0x${txHash}` })
  if (!tx || !tx.blockNumber) return false
  const latestBlock: Block = await client.getBlock({ blockTag: 'finalized' })

  console.log(`Latest block: \t\t${latestBlock.number}`)
  console.log(`Your transaction block: ${tx.blockNumber}`)

  if (latestBlock.number !== null && latestBlock.number - tx.blockNumber >= 256) {
    return true
  } else {
    return false
  }
}
```

Here's the implementation of Checking Transaction Finality AFTER Milestones Implementation
```typescript
async function milestones_checkFinality(client: any, txHash: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const tx = await client.getTransaction({ hash: `0x${txHash}` })
  if (!tx || !tx.blockNumber) return false
  const latestBlock: Block = await client.getBlock({ blockTag: 'latest' })
  const finalizedBlock: Block = await client.getBlock({ blockTag: 'finalized' })

  console.log(`Latest block: \t\t${latestBlock.number}`)
  console.log(`Latest Finalized block: ${finalizedBlock.number}`)
  console.log(`Your transaction block: ${tx.blockNumber}`)

  if (finalizedBlock.number !== null && finalizedBlock.number > tx.blockNumber) {
    return true
  } else {
    return false
  }
}
```

> Please note that this is just a demo purpose to show the previous implementations, since Milestones has already been implemented in the protocol, therefore, 16 blocks is the minimum time for finality, the `pre_milestones_checkFinality` function is not needed anymore in actual implementation. Just use the `milestones_checkFinality` function to check your transaction finality.

### 3.3 Running the Code Locally

- Step 1: Copy the code into a file named milestones.ts.

- Step 2: Install the required dependencies by running: 
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Step 3: Run the code using Node.js with the required command-line arguments:
  ```bash
  npx ts-node milestones.ts --txHash <transaction_hash> --function <function_name> --network <network_name>
  ```
  Replace <transaction_hash> with the actual transaction hash, <function_name> with either pre_milestones or milestones, and <network_name> with either polygon or amoy.

- Step 4: Observe the output to determine if your transaction has been finalized based on the selected milestone mechanism and network.

### 3.5 Results

The results should show whether the transaction has been finalized based on the selected milestone mechanism and network.
Usually Milestones will taking 1-2 minutes to finalize the transaction. Result as follows:

#### Milestones Example

When the transaction is still pending, the `milestones_checkFinality` function will show the following:
![milestones_result](./pics/milestones_pending.png)

When the transaction is finalized, the `milestones_checkFinality` function will show the following:
![milestones_result](./pics/milestones_succeed.png)

As you can see, there's always few blocks difference between latest block and finalized block, which is the buffer and the voting period for the milestone. Once the finalized block is higher than the transaction block, the transaction is considered finalized.

#### Pre-Milestones Example

Here's a screenshot of the `pre_milestones_checkFinality` function, where it shows that the new blocks are not yet 256:
![pre_milestones_result](./pics/pre_milestones_pending.png)

Here's a screenshot of the `pre_milestones_checkFinality` function, where it shows that the new blocks are 256:
![pre_milestones_finalized](./pics/pre_milestones_succeed.png)

As you can see, there's no finalized block in the pre-milestones implementation, so the transaction is considered finalized once the new blocks are 256, aka the latest block is 256 blocks higher than the transaction block.

### 3.4 Experimenting Further
Modify the code to check different transactions and networks to see how finality is achieved with milestones on various Polygon networks.
